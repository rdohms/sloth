# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.0.1 - 2016-03-17

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#53](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/53)
  updates the default Pimple container script such that it now caches factory
  instances for re-use.
- [#72](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/72)
  updates the `composer.json` to remove the possibility of installing an
  Expressive RC version, updates zend-servicemanager to allow using 3.0
  versions, and updates whoops to allow either 1.1 or 2.0 versions.
- [#80](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/80)
  updates the default ProxyManager constraints to also allow v2 versions.
- [#81](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/81)
  fixes an issue in the installer whereby specified constraints were not being
  passed to Composer prior to dependency resolution/installation, resulting in
  stale dependencies.
- [#78](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/78)
  updates the shipped default error templates to remove error/exception display.
  Users who really need this functionality can write their own templates; the
  project aims to deliver a "safe by default" setting.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-01-28

First stable release.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#69](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/69)
  updates the links in templates to point to the new documentation site on
  https://zendframework.github.io/zend-expressive/ instead of rtfd.org.

## 1.0.0rc8 - 2016-01-21

Eighth release candidate.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#66](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/66)
  adds the `'error' => true,` declaration to the `'error'` pipeline middleware
  specification.
- [#67](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/67)
  updates the `filp/whoops` dependency for installer development to `^1.1 || ^2.0`;
  the two are compatible for our use cases, but we should prefer the latest
  that can be installed. As 2.0 requires PHP 5.5.9, but our minimum PHP version
  is 5.5.0, we must specify both.

## 1.0.0rc7 - 2016-01-19

Seventh release candidate.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#64](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/64)
  fixes the installer script to correctly rewrite the `require-dev` section
  and ensure only the development dependencies selected, as well as base 
  requirements such as PHPUnit and PHP_CodeSniffer, are installed. As such,
  the `--no-dev` flag is no longer required, and development dependencies
  such as whoops are properly installed.

## 1.0.0rc6 - 2016-01-19

Sixth release candidate.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#56](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/56)
  updates the `composer serve` command to include the `public/index.php` script
  as an argument. This ensures that asset paths that the application could
  intercept and serve will be passed to the application (previously, the
  built-in server would treat these as 404s, and never pass them to the
  application).
- [#57](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/57)
  updates the Apache configuration rules defined in `public/.htaccess` to omit
  several that could prevent the application from intercepting requests for
  assets.
- [#52](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/52)
  fixes the switch statement in the `HomePageAction` class to ensure the
  template name and documentation link are accurately found.
- [#59](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/59)
  updates the `config/container.php` implementation for zend-servicemanager such
  that it can work with either v2 or v3 of that library.
- [#60](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/60)
  updates the zend-expressive-helpers dependency to `^2.0`, and updates the
  `config/autoload/middleware-pipeline.global.php` to follow the changes in
  middleware configuration introduced in [zend-expressive #270](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive/pull/270).
  The change introduces convention-based keys for "always" (execute before
  routing), "routing" (routing, listeners that act on the route result, and
  dispatching), and "error", with reasonable priorities to ensure execution
  order.
- [#60](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/60)
  fixes the documentation for `composer create-project` to include the
  `--no-dev` flag; this is done as composer currently installs the development
  dependencies listed before the installer script rewrites the `composer.json`
  file. Running `composer update` or `composer install` within the project
  directory after the initial installation will install the development
  dependencies.

## 1.0.0rc5 - 2015-12-22

Fifth release candidate.

### Added

- Nothing.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#42](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/42)
  fixes some grammatical issues in the questions presented by the installer.
- [#45](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/45)
  fixes how JS and CSS assets are added to zend-view templates.
- [#48](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/48)
  adds unit tests for the `OptionalPackages` class (which provides the Composer
  installer scripts).
- [#49](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/49)
  updates the Pimple support to Pimple v3, ensuring Pimple users are using the
  latest stable release.

## 1.0.0rc4 - 2015-12-09

Fourth release candidate.

### Added

- [#34](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/34)
  updates the zend-view configuration to register a factory for
  `Zend\View\HelperPluginManager`, as well as a `view_helpers` sub-key for
  registering custom view helpers.
- [#37](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/37)
  creates the subdirectories `src/App/` and `test/AppTest/`, moving the
  subdirectories of each under those, and updating the `composer.json`
  autoloading directives accordingly. This change will allow new projects to
  implement a "modular" structure if desired, with a subdirectory per namespace.
- [#41](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/41) adds
  the composer script "serve", which fires up the built-in PHP webserver on port
  8080; invoke using `composer serve`.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#23](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/23)
  updates the comment for the glob statements to ensure all 4 (not just 2!)
  possible matches are detailed.
- [#24](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/24)
  updates the `config/config.php` file to store cached configuration as a plain
  PHP file, so that it can simply `include()`; this will be faster than using
  JSON-serialized structures.
- [#30](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/30)
  updates the Twig configuration to follow the changes made for
  [zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer 0.3.0](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-twigrenderer/releases/tag/0.3.0).
  The old configuration format will still work, though users *should* update
  their configuration to the new format. The change in this patch only affects
  new installs.
- [#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/33)
  updates to zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers `^1.2`.
- [#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/33) adds
  configuration for auto-registering the new `Zend\Expressive\Helper\UrlHelperMiddleware`
  as pipeline middleware; this fixes an issue when using the zend-view renderer
  with the `url()` helper whereby the `UrlHelper` was being registered as a
  route result observer too late to receive the `RouteResult`.
- [#40](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/40)
  renames the namespace for the installer to `ExpressiveInstaller`.

## 1.0.0rc3 - 2015-12-07

Third release candidate.

### Added

- [#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/20) adds
  the ability to specify a "minimal" install; when selected, the installer will
  install modified configuration, omit some files, and remove the default
  middleware and public assets.
- [#27](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/27) adds
  [zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-helpers)
  as a dependency, and integrates the helpers into the configuration.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- [#13](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/13)
  updates the installer to also remove the dependency on composer/composer
  on completion.
- [#11](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/11)
  moves the route middleware service definitions into the routes configuration
  files.
- [#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/21)
  updates `require` statements in generated configuration files to use the
  `__DIR__` constant to ensure files are located relative to the origin file.
- [#25](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/25) and
  [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/29)
  update minimum versions for each router and template implementation (final
  versions for RC3 are all at `^1.0`).
- [#29](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton/pull/29) sets
  the zend-expressive required version to `~1.0.0@rc || ^1.0`, to ensure a
  stable version is always installed.
