# Expressive Skeleton and Installer

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton)

*Begin developing PSR-7 middleware applications in seconds!*

[zend-expressive](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive) builds on
[zend-stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility) to
provide a minimalist PSR-7 middleware framework for PHP with routing, DI
container, optional templating, and optional error handling capabilities.

This installer will setup a skeleton application based on zend-expressive by
choosing optional packages based on user input as demonstrated in the following
screenshot:

The user selected packages are saved into `composer.json` so that everyone else
working on the project have the same packages installed. Configuration files and
templates are prepared for first use. The installer command is removed from
`composer.json` after setup succeeded, and all installer related files are
removed.

## Getting Started

Start your new Expressive project with composer:

```bash
$ composer create-project zendframework/zend-expressive-skeleton <project-path>
```

After choosing and installing the packages you want, go to the
`<project-path>` and start PHP's built-in web server to verify installation:

```bash
$ composer serve
```

You can then browse to http://localhost:8080.

> ### Setting a timeout
>
> Composer commands time out after 300 seconds (5 minutes). On Linux-based
> systems, the `php -S` command that `composer server` spawns continues running
> as a background process, but on other systems halts when the timeout occurs.
>
> If you want the server to live longer, you can use the
> `COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT` environment variable when executing `composer
> serve` to extend the timeout. As an example, the following will extend it
> to a full day:
>
> ```bash
> $ COMPOSER_PROCESS_TIMEOUT=86400 composer serve
> ```

## Troubleshooting

If the installer fails during the ``composer create-project`` phase, please go
through the following list before opening a new issue. Most issues we have seen
so far can be solved by `self-update` and `clear-cache`.

1. Be sure to work with the latest version of composer by running `composer self-update`.
2. Try clearing Composer's cache by running `composer clear-cache`.

If neither of the above help, you might face more serious issues:

- Info about the [zlib_decode error](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/4121).
- Info and solutions for [composer degraded mode](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md#degraded-mode).

## Skeleton Development

This section applies only if you cloned this repo with `git clone`, not when you
installed expressive with `composer create-project ...`.

If you want to run tests against the installer, you need to clone this repo and
setup all dependencies with composer.  Make sure you **prevent composer running
scripts** with `--no-scripts`, otherwise it will remove the installer and all
tests.

```bash
$ composer install --no-scripts
$ composer test
```

Please note that the installer tests remove installed config files and templates
before and after running the tests.
